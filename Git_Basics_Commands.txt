This file will serve as my compilation of all Git and Github commands that I will learn throughout the SpringBoard's Software Engineering Career Track courses.

Here are the Git commands that I learned so far:
	git --version shows the version of your git installation. If Git is not installed, then type:
	sudo apt-get install git. For windows, download from git-scm.com's site.

To first set up Local REPO; do this
	. mkdir local_Repo_Name
	. touch file_Name --> To create file in that directory(Folder)
	. open file_Name --> To open that file

Now, write something to this file, and use following commands
	. git status
	. git add file_Name OR git addd . --> to add all files to staging area
	. (Optional: git status to check on latest git updates of your work)
	. git commit -m "commit message"

Your changes are now pushed to local repository.

NOW, PUSH YOUR WORK TO GITHUB REPO

		To do this, first you need to set up your GitHub repo.
		. Go to Github and create your Remote Repo there

	In the Terminal, do this:
		. git remote add origin URL_for_Github_Repo

TO PUSH YOUR WORK to GitHub Repo, do this:
	. git push Name_of_Remote_Reop Name_Of_Local_Repo_Branch OR, git push origin master

	NOTE:	 This command may require you to type in your user name and GitHub password each time, which is quite tedious. So, use this command to avoid it from typing in user name and Github password for every single push. So, create SSH Key. Instead of typing in git push origin master, you can type only git push if you run the command git push -u origin master.

	If you add your user name and email to local Git Repo, git log will show your name and email.
	To do this, following the following:
		. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
		. git config --global user.email "Your Email"
